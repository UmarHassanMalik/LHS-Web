I’d start like this instead: “Hi. I just read your job posting and it sounds like you need ___”.





P.S. – the proposed cost is an estimate. I could give you an exact figure, timeframe and what I expect to be able to accomplish if we talk. If any of the above sounds interesting, reply to this and we’ll set up a time to talk this week.
